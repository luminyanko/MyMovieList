# my-movie-list | test task

Write a simple website for keeping a list of watched movies. The project should include:
- registration / login
- a list of all movies filtered by genre (a movie can have several genres)
- adding a movie to one of the lists (planned, viewed, dropped)
- remove a movie from the list
- transferring a movie from one list to another
- setting (changing the already set) rating for the film and displaying the average rating on the film page (you can also sort by ratings on the list of all films)
- show films from the same series on the film page (for example, on the film page terminator 1, show also terminator 2,3 in a block from the same series)
- the ability to leave comments about the movie
- the ability to make your list public / hidden, other users should be able to view it.
